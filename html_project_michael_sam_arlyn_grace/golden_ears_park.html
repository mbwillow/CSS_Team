                <p><span itemprop="description">
                    Golden Ears Provincial Park is a Provincial Park in British Columbia, Canada at 555.9 km². It is named after the prominent twin peaks which 
                    are commonly referred to as Golden Ears (Mount Blanshard) (Elevation: 1716 m or 5630 ft). The park's southern end is located on the northern 
                    edge of the district municipality of Maple Ridge on the north side of the Fraser River.

                <p>
                    Since my family lives in Maple Ridge, we often go to Golden Ears park for some relaxing outdoor recreation. There are countless activities to enjoy
                    in the park. Whether you have a family or not, are an avid outdoor person or not, there is something for you at Golden Ears park.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are looking for a short adventure, you can stop at the Spirea trail (only takes 20 minutes to walk the loop trail). Spirea trail is a
                    beautiful loop around a bog and has informational boards along the way providing information about the wildlife and habitat. After Spirea trail,
                    make your way to Alouette lake to enjoy a picnic on one of park tables or bring a canoe or kayak and set out on the lake. There is plenty of 
                    space for lawn games and there are additional trails to walk near the lake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are really feeling adventurous and you have good hiking gear, then I highly recommend tackling the Golden Ears trail. It is an approximately
                    12 km (one-way) trail departing from the West Canyon parking lot. Suggested time is 7 hours, but can definitely take longer. I hiked to the summit
                    with a group of friends and our round trip was about 15 hours, though we were a bit slow going at times. I have heard of others taking about 7-10 
                    hours if you are really booking it.
